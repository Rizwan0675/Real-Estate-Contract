# Real-Estate-Contract
This Github repository contains the code for a real estate contract platform that enables secure and transparent buying and selling of land. The platform enrolls three key stakeholders: buyers, sellers, and land inspectors, and streamlines the buying and selling process while reducing fraud and disputes.
# Stakeholders
## Seller
The Seller is responsible for adding a Land to the contract. The Seller can only add the Land to the contract once they have been verified by the Land Inspector.

## Land Inspector
The Land Inspector verifies the Seller's details and the Land added by the Seller. Once verified, the Land Inspector can approve the Land, which then becomes available for sale to the Buyer.

## Buyer
The Buyer can only buy the Land if the Land has been verified by the Land Inspector, and if the Buyer has been verified by the Land Inspector.

# Features
Only verified Sellers can add Land to the contract
Land can only be added once by a Seller
Land must be verified by the Land Inspector before it can be sold
Buyers must be verified by the Land Inspector before they can buy Land

# Deployment
The Real Estate Smart Contract can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using any Solidity compatible environment. Once deployed, the contract can be interacted with using any Ethereum compatible wallet or application.

# Conclusion
The Real Estate Contract Platform is a secure and transparent way to buy and sell land on the Ethereum blockchain. With its built-in verification process and dispute resolution mechanism, buyers and sellers can be confident in the authenticity of the transaction. Land inspectors can ensure legal compliance and maintain blockchain records, providing a secure and transparent platform for real estate transactions.
